# Skeleton Shooter

**Skeleton Shooter** is a fast-paced, action-packed Unity game where you control an astronaut who must fend off waves of skeletons. The game takes inspiration from the popular "Vampire Survivors" and was developed under a strict time constraint of 2 hours, from brainstorming to execution.

## Features
- **Astronaut Character**: Navigate and control an astronaut equipped with a gun that shoots bullets.
- **Enemy Skeletons**: Each time the astronaut hits a skeleton, more skeletons spawn, increasing the challenge.
- **Endless Waves**: Survive as long as you can against the relentless skeleton horde.

## Controls
- **Movement**: Use the arrow keys or WASD to move the astronaut.
- **Shooting**: Use the space bar to shoot bullets.

## Objective
Survive as long as possible by shooting skeletons and avoiding getting overwhelmed. Each hit on a skeleton causes more skeletons to spawn, testing your reflexes and strategy.

## How to Play
1. **Launch the Game**: Start the game from the Unity Editor or build and run the executable.
2. **Control the Astronaut**: Use the movement keys to navigate your astronaut around the game area.
3. **Shoot Skeletons**: Press the space bar to fire bullets at incoming skeletons.
4. **Survive**: Keep moving and shooting to survive the increasingly difficult waves of skeletons.

## Development Notes
- **Time Constraint**: The entire game, including ideation and development, was created within a 2-hour period.
- **Theme Adherence**: The game was designed to loosely follow the theme of "Vampire Survivors", focusing on the core mechanic of increasing enemy waves.

## Future Improvements
Given more time, we would like to:
- Add more diverse enemy types and power-ups.
- Implement a scoring system to track player progress.
- Enhance the graphics and sound effects for a more immersive experience.

## Credits
- **Development Team**: Luca & Me
- **Tools Used**: Unity Engine version 2022.3.24f1 and still operational in 2024

Enjoy playing **Skeleton Shooter** and see how long you can last against the skeleton onslaught!
